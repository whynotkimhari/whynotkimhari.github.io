Abstract
---

Scene Language describe **structure** (by **programs**), **semantics** (by **words**), and **identity** (by **embeddings**) of visual scene. The representation can be inferred from LLMs (_prompting_).

Introduction
---

- There are scenes that **hard to precisely explain** using natural language.
- Hard to describe but easy to recognize: 
  - **structural knowledge**:  joint distribution of multipl instances ~ **programs**.
  - **category-level semantics**: be shared across instances ~ **semantics**.
  - **instance-level intrinsics**: geometry, color, and texture ~ **embeddings**.
- Other related works have talked about these three modalities but **none of them alone is sufficient** for scene generation and editing.

- Scene Language:
  - **program**: computation process defines the organization of a collection of entities (poses, repetitions).
  - **word**: for each entity to refer to its semantic group (~ where is it?).
  - **embedding**: for each entity to describe its instance-specific attributes (~ how does it look like?).
  - User prompt with **text and/or image** >> LLMs create domain-specific language (DSL) >> render the scene by using the DSL
